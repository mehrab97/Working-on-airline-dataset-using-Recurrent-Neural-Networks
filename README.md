# Working-on-airline-dataset-using-Recurrent-Neural-Networks
The dataset 'international airline passengers' contains data starting from January 1949 to 1960s and the number of passengers travelling internationally during that month. The task here is to predict the number of people travelling next month or for that matter the number of people travelling in the next 12 months. For this, recurrent neural network classifier has been used.
